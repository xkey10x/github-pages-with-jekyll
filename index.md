# Welcome to my small corner of github

## My relevant interests are:
  - Hacking electronics, taking them apart, putting them back together
  - Microcontrollers and programming embedded devices such as esp8266, Arduino of any flavor, Digispark usb dev. board, misc. modules/shields. Employing these embedded devices to create novel, albeit sometimes impractical, solutions to problems faced by myself or others.
  - Raspberry Pi
  - Entrepreneurship
  - GNU/Linux
  - Free (as in freedom) Software
  - Robotics
  - Ethical Hacking/Pentester

## What I'm learning now
As someone who is self taught, my learning process is rarely linear. The lack of a linear educational path leads me to many subjects and can seem sporatic, but it has greatly increased my bredth of knowledge in many different subjects that, otherwise, I would've never ventured into. 
  -python
  -micropython
  -I'm building a spider robot
  -C / C++
  -Studying to become ethical hacker, pentester, or computer forensics expert
